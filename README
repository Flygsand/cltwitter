cltwitter - a command-line utility for Twitter
==============================================

DEPENDENCIES)
 - libcurl
 
INSTALLATION)
make && sudo make install

CONFIGURATION)
Create the file .cltwitter in your home directory and make sure that it is readable:

  cd
  touch .cltwitter

Edit the contents of the file to look like this:
  
  username=<twitter_username>
  password=<twitter_password>
