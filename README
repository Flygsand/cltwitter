==============================================
cltwitter - a command-line utility for Twitter
==============================================

DEPENDENCIES)
=============
 - libcurl
 - libpcre
 - libxml (when compiled with tab-completion)
 
INSTALLATION)
=============
*NIX:
  make && sudo make install
  NOTE: Bash users will want to add the line "source /etc/cltwitter/completion.bash" to
        their .bashrc or .bash_profile to enable tab completion for @replies.

  If you're not using Bash, there's no point in installing the facilities for tab completion.
  In this case, run 'make tweet && sudo make install_tweet' instead to only install the
  Twitter client. This will hopefully be handled by a configure script in the future. 

Windows:
  Binary: Download latest here: http://io.thesmilingpenguin.com/cltwitter/tweet.exe
          Copy it to C:\Windows or C:\Windows\system32 (or any other place that is in your
          PATH).

CONFIGURATION)
==============
Create the file .cltwitter in your home directory.

*NIX
  cd
  nano -w .cltwitter
  chmod 400 .cltwitter

Windows:
  cd C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME
  notepad .cltwitter
  cacls .cltwitter YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME:R
 
The contents of .cltwitter should look like this:
  
  username=<twitter_username>
  password=<twitter_password>
  
where <twitter_username> and <twitter_password> represents the username and password
for your Twitter account. NOTE: The configuration file parser is currently sensitive
to white-space. As an example, "username = john" will not parse, but "username=john" will.  

USAGE)
======
cltwitter supplies a command "tweet" for posting messages to Twitter. The command 
accepts one argument (the message to be sent) on the command line or, if no argument
is given, reads one line from standard input. Both usages are depicted below:

Supplying Twitter message on the command line:
  tweet "Hello Twitter!"

Tweeting a random fortune cookie:
  fortune | tweet

In accordance with Twitter regulations, the supplied message must be 1-140 characters long.
