==============================================
cltwitter - a command-line utility for Twitter
==============================================

DEPENDENCIES)
=============
 - libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se)
 - libpcre (http://www.pcre.org)
 - libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org)
 - liboauth (http://liboauth.sourceforge.net)
 
INSTALLATION)
=============
*NIX:
  make && sudo make install
  NOTE: Bash users will want to add the line "source /etc/cltwitter/completion.bash" to
        their .bashrc or .bash_profile to enable tab completion for @replies.

  If you're not using Bash, there's no point in installing the facilities for tab completion.
  In this case, run 'make tweet && sudo make install_tweet' instead to only install the
  Twitter client. This will hopefully be handled by a configure script in the future. 

Windows:
  Binary: Download "latest" here: http://io.thesmilingpenguin.com/cltwitter/tweet.exe
          Copy it to C:\Windows or C:\Windows\system32 (or any other place that is in your
          PATH). Note that "latest" may actually be far behind the HEAD of master and
          thus lack the latest features.

CONFIGURATION)
==============
NOTE: If you are not planning on using Twitpic, you need not do any configuration at all. 
cltwitter now supports OAuth, and upon your first tweet you will be asked to authorize cltwitter 
to post messages to your Twitter timeline. Twitpic doesn't support OAuth at the moment, so 
therefore cltwitter needs your username and password. However, the communication is secure 
as it takes place over HTTPS. cltwitter will be switching to img.ly (which supports OAuth) 
for image uploading in future versions, which will make this section obsolete.

Create the file .cltwitter in your home directory.

*NIX
  cd
  nano -w .cltwitter
  chmod 400 .cltwitter

Windows:
  cd C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME
  notepad .cltwitter
  cacls .cltwitter YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME:R
 
The contents of .cltwitter should look like this:
  
  username=<twitter_username>
  password=<twitter_password>
  
where <twitter_username> and <twitter_password> represents the username and password
for your Twitter account. NOTE: The configuration file parser is currently sensitive
to white-space. As an example, "username = john" will not parse, but "username=john" will.  

USAGE)
======
NOTE: The first time "tweet" is invoked, you will be asked to authorize cltwitter
access to your Twitter profile on Twitter's site. cltwitter uses the OAuth scheme 
which eliminates the need for sending passwords over the wire.

cltwitter supplies a command "tweet" for posting messages to Twitter. The command 
accepts one argument (the message to be sent) on the command line or, if no argument
is given, reads one line from standard input. Both usages are depicted below:

Supplying Twitter message on the command line:
  tweet "Hello Twitter!"

Tweeting a random fortune cookie:
  fortune | tweet

Using the tab-completion feature:
  tweet "@s<TAB>
  @sourcebits @spolsky

Tweeting a picture to Twitpic:
  tweet "An image says more than a thousand tweets." ~/images/birdhouse.jpg

NOTES)
======
As usual the tweets must be 1-140 characters long. 

HAPPY TWEETING!
