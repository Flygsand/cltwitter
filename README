==============================================
cltwitter - a command-line utility for Twitter
==============================================

DEPENDENCIES)
=============
 - libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se)
 - libpcre (http://www.pcre.org)
 - libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org)
 - liboauth (http://liboauth.sourceforge.net)
 
INSTALLATION)
=============
*NIX:
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

Windows: 
  Download the "latest" cltwitter binary from
  http://github.com/mtah/cltwitter/downloads Copy it to C:\Windows or
  C:\Windows\system32 (or any other place that is in your PATH). Note
  that "latest" may actually be far behind the HEAD of master and thus
  lack the latest features.

CONFIGURATION) 
============== 
NOTE: If you are not planning on using Twitpic to post images via
cltwitter , you need not do any configuration at all.  cltwitter now
supports OAuth, and upon your first tweet you will be asked to
authorize cltwitter to post messages to your Twitter timeline. Twitpic
doesn't support OAuth at the moment, so therefore cltwitter needs your
username and password. However, the communication is secure as it
takes place over HTTPS.

Create the file .cltwitter in your home directory.

*NIX
  cd
  nano -w .cltwitter
  chmod 400 .cltwitter

Windows:
  cd C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME
  notepad .cltwitter
  cacls .cltwitter YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME:R
 
The contents of .cltwitter should look like this:
  
  username=<twitter_username>
  password=<twitter_password>
  
where <twitter_username> and <twitter_password> represents the
username and password for your Twitter account. NOTE: The
configuration file parser is currently sensitive to white-space. As an
example, "username = john" will not parse, but "username=john" will.

USAGE)
======

Supplying Twitter message on the command line:
  
  $ tweet "Hello Twitter!"

Tweeting from standard input:
  
  $ fortune | tweet

Using the tab-completion feature:
  
  $ tweet "@s<TAB>
  @sourcebits @spolsky

Tweeting a picture to Twitpic:
  
  $ tweet "An image says more than a thousand tweets." ~/images/birdhouse.png

Upload, but do not tweet:
  
  $ tweet "This is a photo." ~/images/photo.jpg --upload-only

NOTE: The first time the "tweet" command is invoked, you will be asked
to grant cltwitter access to your Twitter profile. cltwitter uses the
OAuth scheme which eliminates the need for sending passwords over the
wire.

NOTES)
======
As usual the tweets must be 1-140 characters long. 

HAPPY TWEETING!
